# Rise on Linux

[Supported versions](./docs/supported-versions.md)

Message me on Discord(`enorsu`) for support.

This is a workaround to run [Rise Client](https://riseclient.com) on Linux(natively). This script does **NOT** support cracked versions of Rise.

[Using the script](https://github.com/enorsu/rise-on-linux/blob/main/docs/using.md)

This script is made by a member of Rise.
